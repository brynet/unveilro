.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
executes commands with an initial read-only
.Xr unveil 2
set.
To allow a lager number of applications to run without any
additional config, write and create operations are permitted in
.Pa /dev
and
.Pa /tmp .
.Pp
As such, it is
.Em NOT
supported to use
.Nm
as root, or recommended with programs that already apply
.Xr unveil 2
or
.Xr pledge 2
themselves.
.Pp
The
.Nm
program should only be used as a last resort, if possible, greater
protection and safety can be better attained through careful
observation and direct source modification of programs.
.Sh EXAMPLES

will optionally check for additional paths to unveil in
.Bd -literal -offset indent
~/.config/unveilro/<cmd>.unveil
.Ed

For example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# Example comment
# path  permissions (any combination of rwcx, or noperm)

~/.savedir rwc

# apply quirks
quirks mkdir_home
.Ed
.Sh SEE ALSO

.Xr ld.so 1
.Sh CAVEATS
.Nm
does not support setuid programs.

utilizes several implementation-specific details on

.Nm
must be installed in
.Pa $HOME/bin
as
.Nm
to operate correctly.
